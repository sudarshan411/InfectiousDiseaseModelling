## Aim of the Project

- To make an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of COVID-19 and interpret the data
- To first fit a simple Susceptible Infectious Recovered (SIR) model for the data for a given region
- To interpret the SIR model and draw conclusions from the model when allowed to run it's course without external intervention
- To extend on the model and fit more sophisticated models, allowing for real-world transmission simulation, using the SEIR model
- To implement an Individual Contact Model (ICM) and model the effects of public health interventions on COVID-19 transmission
